Fork the project repo
Add your PM as a collaborator found in the Github repo settings
Clone your forked repo


Go to your terminal and add the command: git clone * repo link* 


Go to cloned repo (cd name-of-repo) then create a new branch with first name and last name. git checkout -b firstname-lastname


Open project repo then start coding!


When you’re ready to commit your changes, save your changes then go back to terminal then add > commit > push 


git add path/to/file
git add commit -m “your commit message”
git push origin your-branch-name


Go back to Github, click the compare & pull request button. *If that doesn’t show up click the New pull request button.


Choose forked repo as your base repository.


Add TL as a contributor and click pull request. 


DO NOT CLICK MERGE PULL REQUEST. 


Head back over to the project and start working. add > commit > push origin firstname-lastname every time you finish a feature.

Stretch Questions


1. You can't put block elements inside inline elements. Formatting. By default, inline elements do not force a new line to begin in the document flow. Block elements, on the other hand, typically cause a line break to occur 
2. An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
3. ?
4. (<div>,<h1> - <h6>,<p>) , (<span>,<a>) , (<input>)
5. In CSS, the box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The “fix” for the box model would be the use of the box-sizing property.
